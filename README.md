It's just a sample demo using Kotlin Multiplatform for Android, iOS, and Web, incorporating some business logic from NativeWaves.

It doesn't contain any **standard design pattern** or **lifecycle management**. It might have a **memory leak** issue. Although it requests **Microphone permission**, it's just to demonstrate that the Permission API can be used natively using Kotlin Multiplatform.
